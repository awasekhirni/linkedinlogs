IS IT NOT FAIR TO PERFORM A DUE DILIGENCE OF THE EMPLOYER, REPORTING MANAGER AND HR HEAD OF THE COMPANY PRIOR TO EVEN ATTENDING AN INTERVIEW

In the recent days, a recruiter approached me for a position for a role. As per the statement of the recruiter "due to client confidentiality reasons. i cannot disclose the specific company name until the interview stage".
As a candidate, i have equal rights to investigate an employer's professional ethics, conduct prior to even spending time to attend an interview. With my past experiences working with unethical, no integrity employers who have gaslit,
lied and played me. I strongly believe every employee should ask for references and are entitled to learn about the employer, their reporting manager and HR Head of the organization. They should equally investigate
as they are investing their time, health, and their families well being. Just because someone is paying some money for your services, they are entitled to do what ever they want. Every job is a two-way street. Here are some reasons why
